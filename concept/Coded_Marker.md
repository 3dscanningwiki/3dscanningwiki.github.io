# Coded Marker

Coded markers are a usually unique black and white marker which get picked up by software. They are placed before scanning an object, and are automatically detected when processing the images. Due to the uniqueness of each marker, the software can distinguish them. They can act as a scale reference when the distance between at least 2 markers is known, or just help with aligning the pictures due to their high contrast.
Multiple types of coded markers exist, and many software packages have support for multiple.
