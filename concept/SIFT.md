# Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)

**[SIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform)** is a computer vision algorithm to extract features from an image. Extracted features from multiple images can be compared, and the same feature on all images can be extracted. Applications for this algorithm include object recognition, image stitching, gesture recognition as well as [photogrammetry](../Photogrammetry.md).
