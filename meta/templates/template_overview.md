## Specific Overview

Give an overview of the subject that the readers would want to read about.  
We are using ‘Heading 2’ for these main level information blocks

This could be, in the case of Photogrammetry, a ‘Common Process’ where you can break down the Common elements of Feature detection, SFM, MVS and more into subsequent child information sections.

Please make as many of these main level information blocks as needed to cover a subject.

### Child Information

For topics which need to break down  even further, IE specefic details about feature detection.  
If this information block gets too busy its best split into its own page.

## Software

Please list any software here.  
There can be comparison charts for features however there must be zero bias in this  
Any and all bias will be removed.

## Hardware

Please list hardware here  
For topics such as photogrammetry which have increadibly broad hardware options please link to a sub-page, ie “Photogrammetry_Hardware”

For topics with a strong DIY community or DIY options, then please link to a DIY page

## Resources

Please link to any strong (generally unbiased) videos on the topic, if this gets too broad then please link to a sub page, ie “Photogrammetry_Resources”
