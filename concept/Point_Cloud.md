# Point Cloud

A point cloud is a unorganised set of points, that usually represent the surface of an object.

Every point in a point cloud has a set of coordinates as well as possible other metadata like colour, normal vector, scan precision, and recording timestamp.

## Uses

When laser scanning, point clouds are directly created by the scanner, whereas in [photogrammetry](../Photogrammetry.md) the point cloud is a result of one of the computation steps.

Photogrammetry software, as well as other software can reconstruct a [mesh](Mesh.md) from a point cloud.
