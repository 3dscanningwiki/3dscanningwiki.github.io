# Meshroom

[**Meshroom**](https://alicevision.org/#meshroom) is an open-source photogrammetry tool built on the [AliceVision framework](https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision).
It uses a node based workflow to control the reconstruction parameters.

## Specific Overview

The Meshroom software is a split into distinct parts: The user interface and the AliceVision backend. 
The user interface contains the images pane, the 3D viewer and the graph editor, which can be used to define a processing pipeline. The configured pipeline can either be executed directly from the user interface, or be saved and executed using the headless command line version of Meshroom, for example on a server.
