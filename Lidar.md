## Methods

[**Lidar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) ([/ˈlaɪdɑːr/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English), also **LIDAR**, or **LiDAR**; sometimes **LADAR**) is a method for determining [ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranging) (variable distance) by targeting an object with a [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser) and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver. Lidar can also be used to make digital [3D representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling) of areas on the earth's surface and ocean bottom, due to differences in laser return times, and by varying laser wavelengths. It has terrestrial, airborne, and mobile applications.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar#cite_note-1]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar#cite_note-2]
