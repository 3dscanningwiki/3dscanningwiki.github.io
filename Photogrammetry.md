# Photogrammetry

*This topic is a work in progress and will look very unfinished.*

**Photogrammetry** is the science and technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment through the process of recording, measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns.

Understanding how and why Photogrammetry is used, and where to use it is critical within the industry of digital acquisition.

There are many variants of Photogrammetry, however this topic will limited to the the process of extracting useful data from images, with the end goal of producing 3 Dimensional measurements either for the further use in real time rendering, Manufacturing inspection and survey.

## Methods

Typical photogrammetry is seen as the process of taking many images of a surface.

### Child Information

For topics which need to break down  even further, IE specific details about feature detection.  
If this information block gets too busy its best split into its own page.

## Applications

## Software

Please list any software here.  
There can be comparison charts for features however there must be zero bias in this  
Any and all bias will be removed.

## Hardware

Photogrammetry hardware is a broad topic, however here it is broken down into two sub-categories, Acquisition and Processing

### Data Acquisition

As a rule of thumb,  best tool for capturing images is the camera you have on you at the time, however when it comes to acquiring the best data there are several key factors to consider

Lighting
