## Methods

[**Lidar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) ([/ˈlaɪdɑːr/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English), also **LIDAR**, or **LiDAR**; sometimes **LADAR**) is a method for determining [ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranging) (variable distance) by targeting an object with a [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser) and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver. Lidar can also be used to make digital [3-D representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling) of areas on the earth's surface and ocean bottom, due to differences in laser return times, and by varying laser wavelengths. It has terrestrial, airborne, and mobile applications.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar#cite_note-1]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar#cite_note-2] 

### Child Information

For topics which need to break down even further, IE specific details about feature detection. 
If this information block gets too busy its best split into its own page.

## Applications

## Software

Please list any software here. 
There can be comparison charts for features however there must be zero bias in this 
Any and all bias will be removed.

## Hardware

Photogrammetry hardware is a broad topic, however here it is broken down into two sub-categories, Acquisition and Processing

### Data Acquisition

As a rule of thumb, best tool for capturing images is the camera you have on you at the time, however when it comes to acquiring the best data there are several key factors to consider

Lighting

Please see Photogrammetry Hardware for a full list of commonly used equipment

## Resources

Please link to any strong (generally unbiased) videos on the topic, if this gets too broad then please link to a sub page, ie "Photogrammetry_Resources"
