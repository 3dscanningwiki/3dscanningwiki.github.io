# Reality Capture

[**Reality Capture**](https://www.capturingreality.com/) is a proprietary photogrammetry software made by CapturingReality. It is most commonly used in the virtual reality, visual effects, gaming, surveying, and cultural heritage industries.


## Specific Overview

<!-- Give an overview of the software, Are there multiple versions? can you use it for free? what is the expected industry for this software? -->


## Software License / Pricing

Reality Capture is available in two pricing models: Pay-Per-Input (PPI) and the unlimited enterprise license ^[https://www.capturingreality.com/Products].

The PPI license is a pre-paid point based system, where the cost is dependent on the dataset. Currently a pack of 8000 credits costs 20USD. The software can be used without spending any PPI points, which only become due when exporting anything. Once payed, the dataset is considered "licensed" and all other exports can be made free of charge. The price of a dataset is calculated by the total number of megapixels of all input images. The exact cost of a dataset can be calculated using the [PPI credits calculator](https://www.capturingreality.com/RC-ppi-credits-calculator).

The unlimited enterprise license currently goes for 3750USD and is perpetual.

## Software Features

Besides basic photogrammetry (aligning cameras, creating point clouds, calculating a mesh), Reality Capture's features include texture projection, mesh post processing (filtering, smoothing), geo referencing, scaling, aligning coded markers, parallel projections and various exports and imports.
