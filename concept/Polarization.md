# Polarization

Polarization refers to the process of restricting light waves to only oscillate on one axis.

This is an example of two orthogonal polarizing filters, one which filters along the x axis, the other filters along the y axis.

## Uses of Polarizing Filters

Polarizing filters are commonly used in photography to reduce glare from reflective surfaces in photographs. Natural light is unpolarized. When unpolarized light gets reflected at a steep angle it gets polarized ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster%27s_angle] as seen in this illustration:

A polarizing filter can be adjusted to filter out exactly this polarized angle, resulting in a photo with much less glare. The example below shows the same image **a)** with a polarizer and **b)** without polarizer.
