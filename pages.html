Understanding how and why Photogrammetry is used, and where to use it is critical within the industry of digital acquisition. There are many variants of Photogrammetry, however this topic will limited to the the process of extracting useful data from images, with the end goal of producing 3 Dimensional measurements either for the further use in real time rendering, manufacturing, inspection and survey. Methods Typical photogrammetry is seen as the process of taking many images of a surface or object. These images are fed into a photogrammetry software which processes them to extract info about the photographed objects. Applications Software See the Photogrammetry section on the Software page. Hardware Photogrammetry hardware is a broad topic, however here it is broken down into two sub-categories, Acquisition and Processing Data Acquisition As a rule of thumb, best tool for capturing images is the camera you have on you at the time, however when it comes to acquiring the best data there are several key factors to consider: Lighting Depth of field Shutter speed ISO Sharpness Lighting In general it is preferred to have even diffuse lighting from all sides, and no visible shadows or highlights on the object itself. Moving shadows can be interpreted by the photogrammetry software as a feature point, which can negatively impact the resulting geometry. Fixed shadows will most likely not impact geometry too much, but it will be visible in the texture as baked in lighting, which will look bad if the object is rendered in a scene where the lighting does not match the condition where the object was scanned. The easiest way to achieve a very diffuse light is to wait for a overcast day and scan the object outdoors. Other options include big soft-boxes and photography tents. Most professional 3d scanners use a ring flash light around the camera lense. This way the visible part of the object is fully illuminated, and no shadows are ever visible to the camera. Depth of field Photogrammetry software searches for feature points in the images, which it can match with the same point in as many images as possible. These feature points need to have a high contrast and be as sharp as possible. Therefore the images need to have as much in focus as possible. It is generally recommended to use an aperture with f8 to f11 . Shutter speed When scanning an object handheld, it is important to use a fast shutter speed, as motion blur will make finding the feature points more difficult or even impossible. In general it is recommended to keep the shutter speed as high as possible, although when using a tripod with an external shutter release the shutter speed can be decreased to allow for a lower ISO or smaller aperture. ISO The ISO setting of a digital camera determines how sensitive the camera sensor is to light. A higher ISO setting results in a brighter image. As a side effect, a high sensitivity also means the sensor will pick up more noise. To get the best results, it is preferable to keep the ISO as low (close to ISO 100) as possible. Depending on the sensor higher values are tolerable. Sharpness For the same reasons as mentioned in the depth of field section, it is preferable to capture as sharp images as possible. Generally the sharpness depends on the camera lense. For most lenses there exists some documentation on their sharpness and what lense settings (zoom, aperture) result in the sharpest image.

It is based on the fact that the amount of light reflected by a surface is dependent on the orientation of the surface in relation to the light source and the observer. By measuring the amount of light reflected into a camera, the space of possible surface orientations is limited. Given enough light sources from different angles, the surface orientation may be constrained to a single orientation or even over-constrained.

They are placed in the scene before scanning an object, and are automatically detected when processing the images. Due to the uniqueness of each marker, the software can distinguish them. They can act as a scale reference when the distance between at least 2 markers is known, or just help with aligning the pictures due to their high contrast.Multiple types of coded markers exist, and many software packages have support for multiple. Types of markers: a) Circular, b) April Tags, c) non-coded markers a) Circular Markers b) April Tags c) Non coded markers Circular Markers Circular markers usually consist of an inner circle with a small white dot, and of the coded outer circle. The center white dot has the advantage that in case the software does not pick the marker up automatically, a human can easily mark the center of the tag manually. Software Compatible 3DF Zephyr No Agisoft Metashape Yes (pro only) Apple Object Capture No [?] Reality Capture Yes April Tags April tags were first introduced by Edwin Olson in 2011 as a robust and flexible fiducial system for usage in autonomous robots . They are designed similar to QR-codes to be recognized by software, which makes them optimal for use in photogrammetry as well. Most photogrammetry software that supports coded markers supports some of the versions of april tags as well. Like QR-codes, april tags consist of a grid of black and white cells, composing a tow-dimensional bar code. However, they are designed for a much smaller data size between 4 to 12 bits. This allows them to be detectable and decodable under much worse circumstances. Software Compatible 3DF Zephyr Yes Agisoft Metashape Yes (pro only) Apple Object Capture No [?] Reality Capture Yes April Tag Variants There are multiple generations of april tags, with the newest being AprilTag 3 (in review) and the most used being AprilTag 2. AprilTags come in multiple payload capacity and error correction versions. They are usually denoted with a name in the following format: 36h11, where 36 refers to a 36 bit encoding, and the 11 refers to a minimum Hamming distance of 11 bits between any valid tags. In short, increasing the first number leads to bigger tags and more possible unique tags. Increasing the second number decreases the number of false positives that are picked up by the software, but also reduces the amount of possible unique tags. AprilTags are designed to work with low resolution images, where the likelihood of noise resembling a valid tag is extremely small. For high resolution images as is commonly used in photogrammetry, it is recommended to use a tag with a high Hamming distance, such as the previously named 36h11. Non-coded markers Markers that do not include any kind of code usually provide a hight contrast features for photogrammetry software to recognize. In addition they make it easier for humans to manually find the same points in multiple pictures for manual control points. https:\u002F\u002Fwww.3dflow.net\u002Fzephyr-doc\u002Fen\u002FPrintMarkersandmarkersuse.html https:\u002F\u002Fwww.agisoft.com\u002Fpdf\u002Fmetashape-pro_1_8_en.pdf https:\u002F\u002Fsupport.capturingreality.com\u002Fhc\u002Fen-us\u002Farticles\u002F360003869672-How-to-use-Detect-Markers-Tool Olson, E.

Our current page priority list can be found here at page priority list .We are also working on setting up the template for all of our articles to be based upon. Submission Rules Due to the early nature of this wiki, we must setup some strict rules.Please see them at submission rules \"},{\"title\":\"Contributing guide\",\"description\":\"How to add and update content on this wiki.\",\"tags\":[\"meta\"],\"id\":18,\"slug\":\"meta\u002Fcontributing_guide\",\"text\":\"Contributing Guide Thank you for considering to contribute to the wiki! If you need a place to start, have a look at the page priority list . Making changes To make changes you will need a GitHub account . If you have an account there are two ways to make changes to the wiki: You can either clone the whole repository and edit the content locally, then push the changes back to github (basic knowledge of git required). You can make changes directly on the website. For example click the \\\"Edit this page\\\" link at the bottom of any page and the editor will open in a new tab. For a tutorial on how to use the editor, watch this video on how to use github.dev to edit the wiki and commit the changes. For any changes to go live, they have to get merged into the repository. This will happen as soon as someone has taken a look at your changes and accepted them. Creating new pages If you want to create a new page, look the list of templates if one of the templates matches the page topic. Frontmatter Every wiki page needs a frontmatter: a section at the top of the file, containing the title, a description and other metadata. The frontmatter has the following format: --- title: Frontmatter example # Required description: How to use the frontmatter tags on this wiki # default: empty tags: [how-to, meta, frontmatter] # default: empty published: true # default: true alias: [meta\u002Fcontributing_guide] # default: empty wip: false # default: false --- Citations Be liberal with linking to resources in footnotes. If referring to a scientific paper try to find the Bibtex citation format and convert it to a text citation using the Online Bibtex Converter . Usually such citations are best placed in an external footnote (see below). Images Please try to be conservative with the amount (and size) of images used on this wiki. This wiki is currently hosted on github which is designed for text-based documents and not images. Wikipedia allows hotlinking to their images, as long as the particular image license allows it. Please make sure to always include appropriate credits to the original author, even if not required by the license. For pages that require many, or high resolution images, consider hosting them on a reliable image host like imgur for now. Markdown format This wiki is made using the Markdown formatting language, which should be mostly self-explanatory. For an in-depth reference see the Markdown documentation . Currently html is not allowed. If you need it, please open an issue and explain your use case. We use a few addons to the markdown format which used as follows: Comments Comments can be added to add notes visible only when editing the file, they will not show up on the wiki page. They take the following form:\u003C!-- my comment here --\u003E. Currently only single line comments are supported. Footnotes Footnote, citations and similar references can be added with the footnotes addon: Example text with an ^[Inline footnote] and an external footnote [^1]. [^1]: Like this. Example text with an and an external footnote . Mathematical Expressions Mathematical expressions can be embedded in text as an inline formula in text $`e = m c^2`$ or as a centered display formula: ```math y_{n+1} = y_0 + \\\\int_{x_0}^x F(t, y_n(t))dt ``` Mathematical expressions can be embedded in text as an inline formula in text or as a centered display formula The expressions are rendered using KaTex .

As we progress, these templates will be updated with nicer CSS. For now the templates are simple, with the goal of allowing for mass data entry. Overview Templates An overview template is to be used for a top level topic that would spawn off a lot of smaller child pagesFor Example, Structured Light Scanning would be a top level topic, and use an overview page.These pages contain broad information about the topic without going into meticulous detail, allowing the reader to quickly understand and read further if needed. The template for Software pages can be found here: template_overview . Software Templates The template for software is very broad, this is due to the wide variety of software used in the 3D scanning industry. When using it, please fill out all fields that are applicable in the tables included, we encourage clear information regarding system requirements, hardware requirements and anything else that may help Since software is such a broad topic, we also request that the sub pages listed in Resource_Templates are used, as things such as API documentation, tutorials and other useful insights are essential for anyone who uses that software. The template for Software pages can be found here: template_software . Hardware Templates The template for Hardware pages can be found here: template_hardware . Workflow Templates Workflow templates are to be used for anything that is to be considered a ‘Guide’ or a list of processes For instance, workflows could be things such as an order of operations for baking textures, fixing lidar station misalignment or even how to get optimal polarizer orientation The template for Workflows can be found here: template_workflow . Comparison Templates Comparisons are to be used with caution, as while they are useful, they can also be very heavily biased. with this in mind we will only setup comparison pages if the data to compare allows the user to come to a conclusion based on what they read.Comparisons should never encourage one software over another. with this in mind, we explicitly request that no-one makes comparison pages without prior approval. Resource Templates Resources are sub-pages of any topic that may have lots of external information pertaining to everything from use cases, API reference, techniques or even blogsThese pages will be curated to ensure that there is no misinformation or advice that may lead people down incorrect paths. All resource pages must follow this naming convention: [parentPageName]_resources the template for resources can be found here template_resources . \"},{\"title\":\"Hardware Template\",\"description\":\"Template for pages about hardware.\",\"tags\":[\"meta\",\"template\",\"hardware\"],\"wip\":true,\"id\":21,\"slug\":\"meta\u002Ftemplates\u002Ftemplate_hardware\",\"text\":\"Hardware Template This template is not done yet, if you have ideas please contribute! \"},{\"title\":\"Overview Template\",\"description\":\"Template for the overview category of pages\",\"tags\":[\"meta\",\"template\",\"overview\"],\"wip\":true,\"id\":22,\"slug\":\"meta\u002Ftemplates\u002Ftemplate_overview\",\"text\":\"Subject Name About Subject Please enter a brief description of the subject that describes what the subject is, where\u002Fwho it came from and how it is used in the industry of 3D scanning Specific Overview Give an overview of the subject that the readers would want to read about.We are using ‘Heading 2’ for these main level information blocks This could be, in the case of Photogrammetry, a ‘Common Process’ where you can break down the Common elements of Feature detection, SFM, MVS and more into subsequent child information sections.

It is most commonly used in the virtual reality, visual effects, gaming, surveying, and cultural heritage industries. Specific Overview Software License \u002F Pricing Reality Capture is available in two pricing models: Pay-Per-Input (PPI) and the unlimited enterprise license . The PPI license is a pre-paid point based system, where the cost is dependent on the dataset. Currently a pack of 8000 credits costs 20USD. The software can be used without spending any PPI points, which only become due when exporting anything. Once payed, the dataset is considered \\\"licensed\\\" and all other exports can be made free of charge. The price of a dataset is calculated by the total number of megapixels of all input images. The exact cost of a dataset can be calculated using the PPI credits calculator . The unlimited enterprise license currently goes for 3750USD and is perpetual. Software Features Besides basic photogrammetry (aligning cameras, creating point clouds, calculating a mesh), Reality Capture's features include texture projection, mesh post processing (filtering, smoothing), geo referencing, scaling, aligning coded markers, parallel projections and various exports and imports. Software Requirements Reality Capture currently only runs on 64bit Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 or Windows Server version 2008+ with the following minimal requirements : 8GB of Ram NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA 3.0+ and 1GB VRAM CUDA Toolkit 10.2 with driver version 441.22+ Hardware Related to the software Resources History 2021-03-09: Epic Games bought Capturing Reality See Also References Any references made in this can be cited here and linked.We do not mind links to blogs or youtube videos, as a lot of topics in this field are uncovered by trial and error, so we can expect a lot of community sourced information to come in this form. https:\u002F\u002Fwww.capturingreality.com\u002FProducts https:\u002F\u002Fsupport.capturingreality.com\u002Fhc\u002Fen-us\u002Farticles\u002F115001524071-OS-and-hardware-requirements https:\u002F\u002Fwww.epicgames.com\u002Fsite\u002Fen-US\u002Fnews\u002Fcapturing-reality-is-now-part-of-epic-games \"}]"}</script></div>
